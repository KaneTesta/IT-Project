The dashboard is where the user manages and views their artefacts and pages, as well as accesses pages that have been shared to them by other users. Users can create new pages from the dashboard by clicking the "Create New Page" button, or access any of their existing pages by clicking on them.

## Pages

The client wanted a focus on artefacts , so they are displayed prominently in a grid format and are the center of the page. Users can add new artefacts by clicking the "Add New Artefact" button, and can view and edit any existing artefact by clicking on it.
