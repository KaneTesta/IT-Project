# What does it do?
Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Using Mongoose, we were able to create multiple schema's to store information surrounding things like our user and their artefacts. To read more about these schema's, view their file pages (found below). From this data, we can then get, put, post, delete, update as necessary, based on the actions of our users. The ability to model and create schema's with mongoose was one of the key factors into going down the path of using MongoDB for our database.
