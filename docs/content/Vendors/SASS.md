SASS is a CSS pre-processor that expands on the functionality of CSS. We use it to define variables for styles that are used throughout the website, such as the color of buttons, the margin and padding sizes, the easing functions for motion in CSS transitions and animations, or the shadows on elements such as dropdowns and dialogs. This means that we can easily change large portions of the site with just one line of code, making it easier to fix style issues as well as allowing us to change aspects of the look and feel of the website based on the client's requests.

## Where we used it

* `scss/`
