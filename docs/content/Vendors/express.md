## What it does

Deployed in our application as it is an easy to configure/customise framework. Express allowed us to define routes of our application based off of our own URLs, integrate EJS and middleware, create a REST API server, and connect to the project's MongoDB database.

## Where we used it

Express is used for out server-side Node.js code. Specifically, `app.js` sets up the express application, `routes/` handles the different endpoint urls used by our backend, and `controllers/` implement the logic for the API endpoints.
