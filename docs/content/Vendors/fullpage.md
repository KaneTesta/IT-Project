# What does it do?
FullPage was utilised to create the effect where each scroll locks to a full section with the same height and width as the browser (Unless the client is on a mobile device). The resources used to learn the library were combinations of JSFiddle, GitHub and other sources. Basically, the combination of a data-menuanchor & section tag defines a section that will be seen as a page. It depends on the scrolloverflow.min.js file, and the main.js file initialises it in the index.ejs file.
