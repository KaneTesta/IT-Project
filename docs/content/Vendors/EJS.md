# What does it do?
Embedded JavaScript is used instead of HTML pages as it allows our site to handle changes automatically. For example, the page you are looking at is generated dynamically since the EJS file iterates through a folder containing markdown and creates a page for each file. The perk of this is that we can continuously add markdown files to this folder and without doing anything, the pages will be made. This is an example that we were able to implement in many scenarios such as rendering artefacts on the dashboard.
