#home.js

This is the file that create's the full page scroll effect on the home page. After the page has finished loading, the loading screen is removed, and the home page is rendered. In this rendering, the home page is divided into core sections that are accessed by the script as anchors to scroll to when the user scrolls either up or down. Notice how the page jumps to the next section on scroll rather than gradually scrolling across, this is the outcome of the function in this file.
