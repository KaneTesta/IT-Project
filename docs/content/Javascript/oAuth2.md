#oAuth2.js

OAuth2 is a version of the OAuth framework that is used in our application to delegate the authorisation of users.

Google Sign-In manages the OAuth 2.0 flow and token lifecycle, simplifying your integration with Google APIs. A user always has the option to create/delete an account, log in/out, grant/revoke access to an application at any time.
