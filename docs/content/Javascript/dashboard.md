# dashboard.js

This script has the focus on rendering the dashboard based on the data it recieves from the different controllers. Basically a call is made to access the user's data, and the following is rendered onto the screen:

* All owned artefacts
* All shared artefacts
* "Add new artefact" box

It also contains all the relevant calls to ignite interactions with the artefacts such as:
* Creating 
* Deleting
* Editing
* Sharing (incl. searching for users)
