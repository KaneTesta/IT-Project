## Kane

- Added documentation for how to use the application
- Started working on the home page, polishing the text to make it less generic.

## Joel

- Documented the css.
- Shows what classes do and how they behave on a web page
- Next Week: Implement css on the front end for the tag system

## James

- Created proof of concept for database export and backup
- Implemented a more memory efficient version that zips images and info to a csv file and allows the user to download it.

## Jordan

- Finished implementing the tag system. Can now select multiple tags and when deselected, relevant objects will reappear.
- Issue: When multiple tags are selected the artefacts will not refresh until all tags are deselected.
- Issue: Tags are case sensitive, leads to duplicates
