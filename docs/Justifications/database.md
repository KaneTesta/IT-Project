## Database

### MongoDB
The project uses a free instance of the Atlas service for document storage. The credentials to read and write to the database have been set as configuration variables on the Heroku instance, and have also been made available on the team's slack for development use.

### Image hosting
We have decided to go with Google Cloud hosting, as it provides $300USD in credit for 12 months, which should be more than suitable for our use case.
