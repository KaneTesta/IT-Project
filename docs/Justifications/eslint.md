## ESLint

ESLint has been added as a dev dependency, the configuration file is located in the root directory as `.eslintrc.json`, currently set up to lint using the airbnb javascript standard, for both front and back end.

To run manually, in the project root directory execute `npx eslint`, there also exist various plugins to automatically lint code as it is written.

ESlint can also be added to the precommit requirements to ensure code quality before a commit is made
